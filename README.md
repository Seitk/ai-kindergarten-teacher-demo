# ai-kindergarten-teacher-demo

Demo project to ChatGPT to play as a kindergarten teacher and talk to my daughter. Just for fun.

- The script started with a role defined in main.py
- It will continuously listen to the microphone, and process with Whisper speech to text after a 2 seconds silence
- Then the transcribed text will be passed to ChatGPT and use gTTS to turn text to speech
